# {{thesis.workingTitle}}

> Your AI-native dissertation environment, set up for you by [dissertation.ai](https://dissertation-ai.dataimago.ai).

This repository is your dissertation's home: where you write your chapters, where the PDF is built, and a structured summary of your project (`dataimago-spec.yaml` — a plain-text file you can read and edit any time).

## Start here

**1. Get a copy on your computer.**

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/{{user.githubUsername}}/{{metadata.name}}.git
cd {{metadata.name}}
```

The `--recursive` flag also pulls in the linked R package that holds your chapters. *If your dissertation has no R package, you can clone normally (without `--recursive`) — your chapters live right here in `thesis/` instead (see step 3).*

**2. Install what you need to build the PDF locally.** You only need these to preview/build the thesis on your own machine (you can also just push and let the build run for you — step 5):

- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) — the document engine.
- [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) for the LaTeX/PDF step: `quarto install tinytex`.
- The fonts the default thesis class uses — the **Noto Sans** family (Noto Sans, Noto Sans Math). Install them from your OS font manager if a build complains a font is missing.
- **R** *only if your dissertation includes an R package* (the no-R path needs none).

**3. Build your knowledge base — the first thing to do in a fresh clone.** Open this folder with your AI. In Claude Code, run **`/ingest`**; in any other tool (Codex, opencode, Cursor, ChatGPT with folder access), ask it: *"Read `.claude/skills/ingest/SKILL.md` and follow it."* Either way it is the same procedure. It reads everything under `raw/` and builds `wiki/` from it: one page per source, the synthesis pages, and a report of what it read, what it inferred, and what is still missing. The AI in this repository works *from* that knowledge base; nothing else here depends on it being clever in a single conversation.

- **Brought a finished dissertation, a folder of code, reports, data?** If it might contain anything private (names, addresses, identifiers), make this repository private on GitHub **first**. Then copy all of it into `raw/inbox/` — as it is, no sorting; the inbox is gitignored, so nothing is committed until `/ingest` has sorted it — and run `/ingest`. It sorts everything, keeps anything private out of git (`raw/private/`, and it will tell you if it found any), and writes `raw/MANIFEST.md`. Then run **`/import-manuscript`**: it turns your dissertation's sources (`.tex`, `.Rnw`, `.docx`; PDF as a last resort) into editable chapters, as **version 1.0** — the originals in `raw/manuscript/` stay locked and untouched.
- **Started fresh at dissertation.ai?** The documents you attached are already under `raw/`; `/ingest` does the rest.

**4. Find where your writing lives.** Each chapter is one file.

- **If you have an R package** (most computational dissertations): your manuscript travels with it as a linked sub-repository (Git calls this a *submodule*). Chapters are at `packages/r-packages/<your package>/ui/www/chapters/*.qmd` — the package's name is `source.rPackage.name` in `dataimago-spec.yaml`.
- **If you don't** (a content-only dissertation, or one whose existing repository is referenced rather than linked): your manuscript lives right here, at `thesis/chapters/*.qmd`. No submodule.

**5. Write + preview.** Edit a chapter, then from the directory that holds `_quarto.yml` (your R package's `ui/www/`, or `thesis/`):

```sh
quarto preview        # live HTML preview while you write
quarto render --to pdf   # build the PDF locally
```

**6. Commit + push.** A GitHub Actions workflow (`build-thesis.yml`) rebuilds the PDF on every push that changes your chapters. The built PDF is committed to **`docs/thesis.pdf`** in the manuscript repo and linked from this app's landing page, alongside the GitHub Pages methodology site (R-package dissertations).

### The submodule mental model (R-package dissertations only)

Your R package is its *own* Git repository; this dissertation repo merely **points** at a specific commit of it. So: edit + commit your chapters **inside the package** (`packages/r-packages/<your package>/`), then come back here and commit the updated pointer. `git clone --recursive` and `git submodule update --init --recursive` keep the two in step. (Content-only dissertations have none of this — everything is in this one repo.)

### Common problems

- **`packages/r-packages/.../` is empty after cloning** — you cloned without `--recursive`. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
- **`tlmgr: command not found` or a missing-font error when building** — see step 2 (install TinyTeX + the Noto fonts).
- **The PDF didn't rebuild after a push** — check the **Actions** tab; the build only fires on pushes that touch your chapters (`ui/www/**` for R-package dissertations, `thesis/**` for content-only ones).

## Editing your dissertation

`<chapters>` below is `packages/r-packages/<your package>/ui/www/` for an R-package dissertation and `thesis/` for a content-only one.

| What you want to change | Where |
|---|---|
| Thesis chapter content | `<chapters>/chapters/*.qmd` |
| Bibliography | `<chapters>/references.bib` |
| Thesis class file (formatting) | `<chapters>/thesis.cls` (or see `THESIS-CLS-README.md`) |
| Methodology R code | `packages/r-packages/<your package>/R/` (R-package dissertations only) |
| Your sources and materials | `raw/` — then run `/ingest` |
| Your knowledge base | `wiki/` — the AI maintains it from `raw/`; you own it (see `KNOWLEDGE.md`) |
| App landing page | `src/app/page.tsx` |
| Dissertation metadata (title, committee, ...) | `dataimago-spec.yaml` |

After editing `dataimago-spec.yaml`, push to `main`; an automated step keeps the generated files in sync.

## Adding committee members + advisor

Edit `dataimago-spec.yaml`'s `vertical.dissertation.advisors` block. The generator updates the signature page template + README.

## Additional information (fill in over time)

Your `dataimago-spec.yaml` accommodates several optional fields the onboarding interview deliberately didn't ask about. They're real dissertation concerns — they affect your title page, signature page, README, and front matter — but they're not what you should be initially burdened with looking up. **Fill them in by editing `dataimago-spec.yaml` directly as they become relevant.** AI assistance in your editor can help.

| Spec field | When it matters |
|---|---|
| `institution.submissionDeadline` | When your defense date solidifies — affects timeline-aware AI suggestions |
| `institution.archiveUrl` | The institutional dissertation library URL where you'll finally deposit |
| `institution.administratorContact` | The person to email for procedural questions |
| `thesis.embargo` | If you plan to embargo (e.g., during a journal publication window) |
| `thesis.coauthors` | If your dissertation is multi-authored |
| `thesis.classFile.guidelinesDocuments` | If your institution publishes a format guide |
| `compliance.irb` | If your work needs IRB approval — number goes on the title page at many institutions |
| `compliance.dua` | If you have data-use agreements that restrict what you can commit publicly |
| `funding` | If you have grant or fellowship support to acknowledge |

The principle: the `dataimago-spec.yaml` is the complete representation of your dissertation; the interview asked only for the essentials. Add structured logistical data over time as it becomes settled.

## Deployment (optional, recommended)

- **GitHub Pages (R-package dissertations):** the R package repo publishes the
  thesis HTML book + PDF + package reference via its `quarto-publish.yml`.
  Enable Pages once (repo Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions) if the
  provisioning flow hasn't already.
- **Knowledge base (GitHub Pages, this repo):** once `/ingest` has seeded
  `wiki/`, `wiki-publish.yml` publishes it —
  theory and methods pages, the claim ledger, and the experiment registry — at
  `https://<you>.github.io/<this-repo>/`. Enable Pages once
  (Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions) if onboarding hasn't.
- **Vercel (this app, optional):** import this repo at
  [vercel.com/new/import](https://vercel.com/new/import) — Next.js is
  auto-detected, no configuration needed; pushes then deploy automatically.
  The landing page reads `dataimago-spec.yaml` at build time, so redeploys
  pick up spec edits. **Vercel is one host among several** — this is a
  standard Next.js app and runs anywhere Next.js runs (Netlify,
  self-hosting, `npm run dev` locally); GitHub is the only requirement.
  `vercel-deploy.yml` offers an opt-in CI-driven alternative whose
  credentials live only in YOUR repo secrets.
- After your first `npm install`, commit the generated `package-lock.json`
  for reproducible installs.
